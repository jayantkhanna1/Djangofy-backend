When you verify your Git account, any project you create will be automatically pushed to your GitHub account. From there, you can easily clone the project to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/<Project Name>.git
```

If you haven't verified your Git account, don't worry! You can still download the project as a zip file and extract it to your local machine. This option is provided at the last step of project creation, so you can easily access and work with the files even without a Git account.

            data = '''

To ensure a clean and organized development environment, it is highly recommended to use a virtual environment when working with any project. You can create a virtual environment for your project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv <name of virtual environment>
```

Once your virtual environment is created, you can activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

Windows:
```bash
.\<name of virtual environment>\Scripts\\activate
```

Linux/Unix:
```bash
source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate
```

By activating your virtual environment, you can ensure that any dependencies and packages you install will be isolated from your global environment, making it easier to manage and maintain your project.

            data = '''
      
To install all the necessary dependencies for your project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will read the requirements.txt file and automatically install all the listed dependencies for you. Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running this command to ensure that the packages are installed in the correct environment. Once the installation is complete, you'll be ready to start working on your project!

<b> Important Note: </b>
Please ensure that you add all the necessary sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, to the .env file. This file is used to store this information securely and is not pushed to GitHub by default. However, please note that we have added the .env file to the repository, but it is empty to ensure that you can fill it out with the required data.

To prevent any accidental disclosure of sensitive information, make sure to add the .env file to the .gitignore file before committing your code to the repository. This way, you can keep your data secure while still being able to utilize the benefits of version control.

We've taken care of the setup for your Rest application so that you can focus on building out your views and logic. All the necessary files and configurations have been created for you, and you don't need to worry about importing or setting anything in settings.py.

To return a REST response from your views, simply write your view as you normally would and return a Response object with the data you want to return. The Response object is already included in the required modules and is automatically configured to work with the REST framework.

So, whether you're returning JSON data, an HTML response or any other format, just build your view and return it using the Response object, and the framework will handle the rest. With the setup work already taken care of, you can focus on building your project with confidence!

```python
def my_view(request):

        'message': 'No worries, we got you covered!'

Great news! We've already set up all the necessary files and configurations for you to create a simple template-based application. This means you can start building your views and logic right away without worrying about the initial setup.

All you need to do is put your HTML files in the templates folder, and your CSS, JavaScript, and images in the static folder, and you're ready to go! You don't need to worry about configuring media routes either because we've taken care of that for you.

With the setup work out of the way, you can focus on building your application and creating the perfect user experience for your users. So, go ahead and start building your application with confidence!

All projects and apps are datauctured in a uniform manner for easy understanding and maintenance. The project folder contains a sub-folder with the same name as the project and contains the main settings, URL routing, and WSGI configuration files. Additionally, there are separate folders for each app within the project, which contain the models, views, and URL routing for each app. The migrations folder within each app handles database migrations. The root folder also contains files such as .env, .gitignore, manage.py, README.md, and requirements.txt for managing project dependencies and version control. This standardized dataucture simplifies development, maintenance, and collaboration on projects.

Before diving into your project, remember to create a database specifically for it and add the necessary credentials to your .env file.

To begin using your project, it is important to create the necessary database migrations and apply them. You can easily do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

These commands will create the necessary migration files and apply them to your database, setting it up for use. With this done, you can now confidently start building your project!

You can now fully concentrate on developing your app's functionality without worrying about managing your models. Our setup dataeamlines everything for you, so you can get started right away with ease.
